# Tere, ma olen Roland Shum ü§ùüèª

Summing myself up in a few words might be a tall order, but here‚Äôs a bit of personal propaganda:

I‚Äôm currently working as a Senior Software Quality Engineer in [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/">
  <img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/4760_malwarebytes.png" width="20" height="20" alt="malwarebytes"></a>, where I am building up test automation on iOS Ô£ø to catch bugs.

I also own a XR Studio called [NT Studio](https://nt-studio.eu/), recently focusing on creating immersive experience on Vision Pro ·ØÖ.

I tinker with code and share my projects here on GitHub, often exploring Test Automation toolkits, XR Framework and Computer Vision projects.
