My name is [Roland Shum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rolandshum/). Summing myself up in a few words might be a tall order, but here’s a bit of personal propaganda:

I’m currently working as a Senior Software Quality Engineer in [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/), where I am building up test automation on iOS  to catch bugs.

I also own a XR Studio called [NT Studio](https://nt-studio.eu/), recently focusing on creating immersive experience on Vision Pro .

I tinker with code and share my projects here on GitHub, often exploring Test Automation toolkits, XR Framework and Computer Vision projects.
